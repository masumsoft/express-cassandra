### Fixed
- Frozen set collections that uses UDTs are not normalized properly and throws schemamismatch error

## [2.2.0] - 2018-02-03
### Changed
- Separate index per table for elassandra instead of a single index for the whole keyspace. This fixes conflicts where the same fieldname with different datatypes exists in different tables. The index names are now of the format: keyspaceName_tableName

### Fixed
- Reserved keywords not quoted in materialized view where query

### Fixed
- Unexpected pause behaviour in fixture import json streamer

## [2.0.0] - 2017-11-10
### Breaking
- Hooks api has some major changes about how it works. Hooks are no longer asynchronous functions. Instead of callback based error or success to control the corresponding operation, it now requires to return true or false instead. This API change helped us to eliminate some major issues related to hooks and hope to prevent future inconsistencies with it.
- Custom schema load and sync has been decoupled and the api changed significantly for good. You can now load the schema and syncDB seperately. You have complete control over loading a schema instance and syncing the schema with cassandra. Also calling the init function is now optional.

### Added
- Support for automatic elasticsearch index management and search analytics for Elassandra users
- Support for automatic graph management and gremlin graph traversals for JanusGraph users
- Support for auto timestamp and versioning fields. This enables automatic creation and management of versionKey, createdAt and updatedAt fields in cassandra against a schema

- Added docs and tests for db_function support

### Changed
- Signifant performance improvement in ORM batches and importer
- Major refactoring to organise the codebase to keep it maintainable.
- Upgraded eslint to version 4
- try-catch instead of try-require for optional modules
- createTable, createKeyspace are now optional and defaults to true

### Fixed
- Buggy alter logic for materialized views, fixes migration hang issues
- Unable to query indexed map with multiple entries
- CamelCased frozen typeDef for UDT incorrectly detect schema mismatch


## [1.10.0] - 2017-09-06
